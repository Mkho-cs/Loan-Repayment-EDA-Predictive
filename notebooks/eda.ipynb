    "Problem statement:<br>\n",
    "Banks, fintech companies, and other institutions that provide loans rigourously need to analyze the credit score for all clients. There are mechanisms such as underwriting reports which assess the fraud risk for a given potential borrower. However, these risk scoring mechanisms only provide information whether to approve or not approve a certain loan. There are greater risk issues with funded loans where the borrower defaults (do not pay off). \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Hence, this loan repayment task is consequential towards objectively assessing the risk of whether a funded borrower can actually pay off their loans. In essence, this task ultimately results in creating <b>predictive models that can accurately predict whether a funded borrower will pay off (True) or default (False).</b> \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "This notebook is the first part of loan repayment task which includes data transformations and exploring actionable data for interesting insights. Data transformation include cleaning unimportant records and columns, aggregating columns to create new parameter(s), and join data together with other datasets to come up with a set of parameters that will be useful for storytelling and later imported for the modelling section.\n",

Since this is a loan repayment problem, <b>we only care about funded loans</b>. Date columns are not relevant since there is no date data on when each loan is actually funded and when the loan is originally supposed to be paid. Hence, the punctuality of loan repayments cannot be measured. As for identification columns, only primary/foreign keys are useful for joins later, hence anon_ssn is removed. \n",
