    "Problem statement:<br>\n",
    "Banks, fintech companies, and other institutions that provide loans rigourously need to analyze the credit score for all clients. There are mechanisms such as underwriting reports which assess the fraud risk for a given potential borrower. However, these risk scoring mechanisms only provide information whether to approve or not approve a certain loan. There are greater risk issues with funded loans when the borrower defaults (do not pay off). \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Hence, this loan repayment task is consequential towards objectively assessing the risk of whether a funded borrower can actually pay off their loans. In essence, this task ultimately results in creating <b>predictive models that can accurately predict whether a funded borrower will pay off (True) or default (False).</b> \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "This notebook is the first part of loan repayment task which includes data transformations. Data transformation include cleaning unimportant records and columns, aggregating columns to create new parameter(s), and join data together with other datasets to come up with a set of parameters that will be useful for storytelling later in the exploratory data analysis (eda) notebook. The same data finalised from this notebook will be used for predictive modelling as well.\n",

    "The listed assumptions are created based on the data given and logical reasoning behind the loan repayment (according to my understanding of the business):\n",
    "</font>\n",
    "\n",
    " - <font size='3'> The payment records are immutable i.e. no further changes or removal made to existing records. (A)</font><br><br>\n",
    " - <font size='3'> Loan status is dynamic, and updates are considered inconsistent. Hence, loan status is not a good indicator of loan repayment (detailed explanation at 'Paid Off Conundrum' section). (B)</font><br><br>\n",
    " - <font size='3'> <b>A paid off loan means that total payment for a certain loan matches the originally scheduled amount, or more in cases of penalties. (C)</b> </font><br><br>\n",
    " - <font size='3'> The loan application follows these stages where applicable, but in the order of: Applied -> Originated -> Approved -> Funded. (D)</font><br><br>\n",
    " - <font size='3'> Each underwriting report is accurate and follows the given guidelines consistently. (E) </font><br><br>\n",

    "<font size='3'>\n",
    "This is arguably the most important part of this notebook, where a new field 'payOff' is created. this field is created as an indicator whether a loan has been paid off. From initial analysis, it is difficult to pinpoint a field that shows whether a loan has been paid off or not. At first glance, 'loanStatus' could indicate a pay off. Although its true that there is a paid off status is 'loanStatus', there are instances of not updated data in loan data. We can observe that some statuses such as 'New Loan' and 'Pending Paid Off' shows that the database is not updated, following the assumption made that all loans are completed when this data is presented.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "There are also inconsistencies in several instances of 'Paid Off Loan' where only a small portion of aggregated payment amount is recorded compared to the originally scheduled amount. <b>Therefore, we can conclude that 'loanStatus' is not a good indicator whether a given loan is actually paid off.</b>\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Since we do not have a definitive field as an indicator of whether a loan is paid off, <b>lets create a new boolean field 'paidOff' by first subtracting the aggregated payment amount with the originally scheduled amount; if the value is greater than or equals to 0, then 'paidOff' will be marked True, and False otherwise.</b>\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "My intuition and logical reasoning from the term 'paid off' is the following: <b>\"A loan is paid off only when the borrower completes the repayment as initially scheduled amount together with any penalty fees that may apply.\" Therefore, this new 'paidOff' field will be used as a target variable for predictive modelling later.</b> From a business standpoint, I believe it is only reasonable that a financial institution want to predict whether a borrower will pay off their loans equal to the initally agreed amount, or else there will be significant loss incured towards the lender.\n",
